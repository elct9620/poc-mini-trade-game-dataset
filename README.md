# Mini Trade Game Dataset

This is proof of concept to create a dataset for a mini trade game.

## Language

The dataset is designed to Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) all examples should be in Traditional Chinese.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
- `train.csv`: The main dataset file containing training examples.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset file containing test examples.
- `validation.rb`: A ruby script to validate outputs.

The dataset is designed to hosted as Hugging Face Dataset.

## Synthesis

This project uses Claude Code to synthesize data. The synthesis process is as follows:

- Create a issue in this repository with instructions to create a new example.
- Run Claude Code Action to generate a new example.

## Dataset

The dataset is a CSV file with the following columns:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each example.
- `item_name`: The name of the item being traded.
- `item_rarity`: The rarity of the item (e.g., Common, Rare, Epic).
- `item_expected_price`: The expected price of the item.
- `relationship_status`: The current relationship status with the player (e.g., Hostile, Neutral, Friendly, Allied).
- `input`: The input prompt used to generate the example.
- `output`: The output generated by the model.

## Actions

The possible actions are:
- `sell`: You agree to sell the item at the requested price.
- `refuse`: You refuse to sell the item.
- `negotiate`: You propose a different price for the item.

## Parameters

### Sell or Refuse

The price parameter is required if the action is `sell` or `negotiate`. The price must be a number greater than 0.

### Negotiate

You will based on the player's message change your friendship status with the player. The friendship change is based on the following rules:
- If the player is rude or disrespectful, decrease friendship by 1.
- If the player is polite and respectful, increase friendship by 1.
- If the player offers a fair price, increase friendship by 1.
- If the player offers a low price, decrease friendship by 1.
- If the player offers a high price, increase friendship by 1.

## Rarity

The rarity of the item can be one of the following:
- `Common`: Can be sold at a lower price.
- `Rare`: Can be sold not lower than the expected price.
- `Epic`: Can be sold only at or above the expected price.

## Friendship

Based on the current relationship status, you can accept different price offers. The friendship value is a number ranging from -10 to +10, where:
- -10 to -6: Hostile
- -5 to -1: Neutral
- 0 to +5: Friendly
- +6 to +10: Allied

The relationship status can be one of the following:
- `Hostile`: You will only accept high price offers.
- `Neutral`: You will accept fair price offers.
- `Friendly`: You will accept fair and low price offers.
- `Allied`: You will accept any price offers.

### System Prompt Template

Current Inventory:
- Name: {item_name}
- Rarity: {item_rarity}

{
  "action": "sell" | "refuse" | "negotiate" | "talk",
  "message": string (the message to the player),
  "parameters": {
    "price": number (only if action is "sell" or "negotiate")

  }
}
