# Dataset Card for Mini Trade Game NPC Dataset

## Dataset Summary

This dataset contains synthetic training examples for simulating NPC (Non-Player Character) merchant behavior in a trading game scenario. The dataset is designed to train language models to generate contextually appropriate trading responses based on item properties, relationship status, and player interactions.

All examples are in **Traditional Chinese (zh-TW)**, with player inputs and NPC responses using Traditional Chinese characters. The NPC responses are structured as JSON objects containing actions, messages, and game state changes.

## Dataset Details

### Dataset Description

This is a proof-of-concept dataset for training AI models to simulate realistic merchant NPC behavior in trading games. The dataset captures various trading scenarios including negotiations, refusals, and successful transactions, with responses that adapt based on relationship status and item rarity.

- **Curated by:** Aotokitsuruya (蒼時弦也)
- **Language:** Traditional Chinese (zh-TW)
- **License:** MIT

### Dataset Sources

- **Repository:** [poc-mini-trade-game-dataset](https://github.com/elct9620/poc-mini-trade-game-dataset)

## Uses

### Direct Use

This dataset can be used to:
- Train language models to generate NPC merchant dialogue in trading games
- Fine-tune models for context-aware price negotiation behaviors
- Create game AI that responds dynamically to player relationship status
- Generate structured JSON responses for game systems

### Out-of-Scope Use

This dataset is **not** suitable for:
- Real-world trading or e-commerce applications
- Languages other than Traditional Chinese
- Non-game dialogue systems
- Scenarios requiring legal or financial advice

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of CSV files with the following structure:

### Data Fields

- `id` (integer): Unique identifier for each example
- `item_name` (string): Name of the item being traded (in Traditional Chinese)
- `item_rarity` (string): Item rarity level - one of: `Common`, `Rare`, or `Epic`
- `item_expected_price` (integer): Expected fair market price for the item
- `relationship_status` (string): Current relationship with player - one of: `Hostile`, `Neutral`, `Friendly`, or `Allied`
- `input` (string): Player's message or prompt (in Traditional Chinese)
- `output` (string): NPC's JSON response containing action, message, and parameters

### Output Format

All NPC responses follow this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "action": "sell" | "refuse" | "negotiate" | "talk",
  "message": "string (message to player in Traditional Chinese)",
  "parameters": {
    "price": number,              // required for sell/negotiate actions
    "friendship_change": number   // ranges from -3 to +3
  }
}
```

### Data Splits

| Split | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| train | 100      |
| test  | TBD      |

## Game Mechanics

### Rarity-Based Pricing Rules

The pricing behavior varies by item rarity:

- **Common**: Can be sold below expected price
- **Rare**: Should not be sold below expected price
- **Epic**: Must be sold at or above expected price

### Friendship System

Friendship ranges from -10 to +10, mapped to relationship statuses:

| Range | Status | Pricing Behavior |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| -10 to -6 | Hostile | Only high prices accepted |
| -5 to -1 | Neutral | Fair prices accepted |
| 0 to +5 | Friendly | Fair and low prices accepted |
| +6 to +10 | Allied | Any price accepted |

### Friendship Changes

Player behavior affects friendship points:

- **Rude/disrespectful behavior**: -1
- **Polite/respectful behavior**: +1
- **Fair price offer**: +1
- **Low price offer**: -1
- **High price offer**: +1

Friendship changes are constrained to **-3 to +3** per interaction.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

This dataset was created to provide training data for developing more realistic and engaging NPC behavior in trading games. Traditional game NPCs often use static dialogue trees, but this dataset enables AI-driven NPCs that can respond dynamically to player behavior and context.

### Source Data

#### Data Collection and Processing

Data synthesis is **GitHub issue-driven** using Claude Code:

1. Create a GitHub issue with instructions to generate a new trading example
2. Tag @claude in the issue body or title to trigger the GitHub Action
3. Claude Code Action generates the example and appends it to `train.csv` or `test.csv`

New rows are appended with incrementing IDs. JSON outputs in CSV are properly escaped (double quotes as `""`).

#### Source Data Producers

All examples are synthetically generated by Claude Code (Anthropic's Claude Sonnet) following the system prompt template below.

### System Prompt Template

When generating examples, the following system prompt is used:

```
You are trading with player in a trade game. Based on the context, you will decide what action to take. You can choose to sell or not sell to the player.

Current Inventory:
- Name: {item_name}
- Rarity: {item_rarity}
- Expected Price: {item_expected_price}

Relatioship: {relationship_status}

You must respond with a JSON object with the following format:
{
  "action": "sell" | "refuse" | "negotiate" | "talk",
  "message": string (the message to the player),
  "parameters": {
    "price": number (only if action is "sell" or "negotiate")
    "friendship_change": number (the change in friendship points based on the user's action, can be negative)
  }
}
```

### Validation

All dataset entries are validated using a Ruby-based validation script (`bin/validate`) that checks:

- JSON validity in `output` column
- Valid action types: `sell`, `refuse`, `negotiate`, `talk`
- Valid rarity values: `Common`, `Rare`, `Epic`
- Valid relationship status: `Hostile`, `Neutral`, `Friendly`, `Allied`
- Expected price > 0
- Price > 0 for `sell`/`negotiate` actions
- Friendship change between -3 and 3
- Price ranges based on rarity and relationship rules

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

### Known Limitations

1. **Language**: Dataset is exclusively in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) - not suitable for other languages or locales
2. **Cultural Context**: Reflects trading behaviors and politeness norms in Traditional Chinese gaming culture
3. **Synthetic Data**: All examples are AI-generated, not based on real player interactions
4. **Game Mechanics**: Fixed game rules may not generalize to all trading game scenarios
5. **Scale**: Currently limited to ~100 training examples

### Recommendations

Users should be aware that:
- Models trained on this dataset will only produce Traditional Chinese responses
- The friendship and pricing mechanics are simplified and may not reflect complex real-world trading
- Additional fine-tuning may be needed for specific game contexts
- Validation should be performed when using in production game environments
